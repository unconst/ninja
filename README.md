# Ninja

A coding agent written entirely by AI through a continuous self-improvement loop. Every line of Rust, every tool, every prompt directive — all generated and refined automatically by running the agent against increasingly difficult tasks and feeding failures back as code changes.

## The Self-Improvement Loop

Ninja wasn't designed by a human. It was **grown** through an automated feedback cycle:

                    ┌─────────────────────────┐
                    │   5. Rebuild & Retest    │

```

An outer agent ([Arbos](https://github.com/unconst/arbos)) orchestrates this loop continuously. It:
- Analyzes rollouts to find failure patterns
- Writes Rust patches to Ninja's source code
- Rebuilds the binary, re-runs tasks, measures the delta
- Pushes improvements that show net-positive results, reverts the rest

This has run for **30+ sessions** producing **99 commits** of improvements — from crash fixes to sophisticated behavioral directives.

## What the Loop Has Discovered

Through hundreds of automated experiments, the loop has uncovered the **competence cliff** — a precise model of when coding agents fail:

- **Isolated bug fixes**: immune to scale (8+ bugs, 8+ files = 100% pass rate)
- **Interconnected fixes**: cliff onset at 4-6 bugs depending on interdependency
- **Code construction**: cliff at 4 files / 6 endpoints
- **Refactoring**: hardest cognitive mode — cliff at 2 modules
- **Key insight**: it's **interconnection**, not complexity, that breaks agents

The loop also identified four distinct failure modes and generated targeted fixes for each:
1. **Propagation incompleteness** → breadth-first directive, pattern propagation
2. **Interface contract violation** → signature checking, return-type preservation
3. **Difficulty-selective attention** → anti-analysis-paralysis alerts, idle nudges
4. **Test gaming** → unfalsifiable test design principles

Each of these was discovered by the loop, not a human. The loop noticed the pattern in rollout data, generated a hypothesis, wrote a code change, and measured the result.

## What Makes Ninja Different

**Every feature exists because it earned its place through measured improvement:**

- **Post-edit lint loop** — added after the loop found syntax errors compounding at high iteration counts
- **Fuzzy edit matching** — added after exact-match edits failed on whitespace variations
- **Phase-check injections** — added after the loop found the agent losing direction mid-task
- **Strategy switching** — added after the loop detected repeated failed edit patterns
- **Plan file auto-recovery** — added after context compaction was found to lose critical state
- **Anti-fabrication directives** — added after the loop caught the agent editing wrong files as substitutes
- **Signature change detection** — added after refactoring tasks revealed interface contract violations

No feature was added speculatively. Every one was a response to a measured failure.

## How It Works

Ninja runs an **agent loop**: it sends a prompt to an LLM, receives tool calls back, executes them locally, and feeds results back. This repeats until the task is done.

```

Model-agnostic via OpenRouter — works with Claude, GPT-4, Gemini, Llama, and anything else available. Dual API format auto-detection (Anthropic vs OpenAI).

cd ninja
cargo build
```

Requires Rust (install via [rustup](https://rustup.rs)). Uses `rustls-tls` — no OpenSSL dependency.

## Usage

```bash
# Set your API key
export OPENROUTER_API_KEY=your-key-here

# Basic usage (defaults to anthropic/claude-sonnet-4)
ninja --prompt "Fix the bug in main.rs"

# Use any OpenRouter model
ninja --prompt "Refactor this" --model google/gemini-2.5-pro
ninja --prompt "Add tests" --model openai/gpt-4o

# With prompt file and working directory
ninja --prompt-file task.md --workdir /path/to/repo

# Save full rollout trace
ninja --prompt "Add tests" --rollout rollout.json --verbose

# Control iteration budget and thinking
ninja --prompt "Implement feature X" --max-iterations 75 --thinking-budget 10000
```

## Benchmarks

### SWE-Bench Pro

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| **pass@1** | **19/215 (8.8%)** |
| Patch rate | 93% (199/215 produced patches) |
| Near-misses | 26 tasks (partial test fixes) |
| Cost per task | $0.16 avg |
| Max iterations | 75 |

*Baseline on 215/731 tasks (29% sample). Full 651-task run in progress (~48% done).*

**Failure breakdown** (196 failures with patches):
- 60% wrong fix / misdiagnosis — patch doesn't address actual issue
- 12% partial fix — some tests pass, not all
- 6% regressions — fixes one thing, breaks another
- 12% Go binary pollution — compiled `.test` artifacts in diffs
- 7% no patch — couldn't localize the bug at all

**Top failure mode**: The agent finds plausible files and produces reasonable-looking patches, but misunderstands what the failing tests actually require. Localization + comprehension is the primary bottleneck, not patch quality.

### Frontier Tasks (175 custom diagnostic tasks)

|----------|-----------|-------|

## The Improvement Pipeline (Arbos)

The outer loop that drives Ninja's improvement lives in the [Arbos](https://github.com/unconst/arbos) repo:

- `tools/swe_gen/` — Task generator: discovers merged PRs from GitHub Archive, clones at base commit, extracts ground truth diffs, packages as evaluation tasks
- `tools/eval_pipeline.py` — Runs Ninja against tasks in Docker containers, evaluates with test suites
- `tools/auto_improve.py` — Reads evaluation results, generates improvement patches to Ninja's Rust source

The loop runs continuously via pm2. When a new weakness is found, it generates frontier tasks targeting that weakness, iterates on Ninja until it improves, then validates on SWE-Bench Pro to confirm the improvement transfers to real-world tasks.
